# Evolving Trends in the Industry

## What is an Agent?

An **agent** is an autonomous system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional software that follows predetermined paths, agents exhibit:

- **Autonomy**: Independent decision-making capabilities
- **Reactivity**: Ability to respond to environmental changes  
- **Proactivity**: Goal-directed behavior
- **Social ability**: Interaction with other agents and humans

## How Agents Differ from Other AI Systems

### LLM vs RAG vs Agent

| System Type | Capabilities | Use Cases | Limitations |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **LLM** | Text generation, reasoning | Q&A, content creation | Static knowledge, no actions |
| **RAG** | Knowledge retrieval + generation | Document search, knowledge base | Limited to retrieval |
| **Agent** | Dynamic reasoning + actions | Task automation, workflows | Complexity, reliability |

### From MLOps to LLMOps to AgentOps

```

## Key Differences Between Each Paradigm

### MLOps Focus
- Structured data pipelines
- Model accuracy metrics
- Batch prediction workflows
- Statistical model validation

### LLMOps Focus  
- Prompt optimization
- Context window management
- Inference cost optimization
- Safety and alignment

### AgentOps Focus
- **Multi-step reasoning** chains
- **Tool integration** and API management
- **Autonomous decision** making
- **Human-in-the-loop** workflows

## Definition of Agent Ops

> **Agent Ops** is the practice of deploying, monitoring, and maintaining autonomous AI systems that can reason, plan, and take actions to achieve complex goals.

Core principles include:

1. **Reliability**: Agents must perform consistently
2. **Observability**: Understanding agent decision-making  
3. **Safety**: Preventing harmful or unintended actions
4. **Scalability**: Supporting multiple concurrent agents
5. **Maintainability**: Evolving agent capabilities over time

## Agent Ops Anti-patterns

### Starting Too Broad

❌ **Bad**: "Build an internal chatbot that answers every possible employee question"

✅ **Good**: "Build an agent that helps with IT support ticket triage"

### Over-Complex Architecture

❌ **Bad**: Supervisor agents managing sub-agents when a simple chain would work

```{mermaid}
graph TD
    U[User Query] --> S[Supervisor Agent]
    S --> A1[Research Agent]
    S --> A2[Analysis Agent] 
    S --> A3[Writing Agent]
    A1 --> S
    A2 --> S
    A3 --> S
    S --> R[Response]
    
    style S fill:#ffcdd2
    class S bad
```

✅ **Good**: Deterministic chain for predictable workflows

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    U[User Query] --> R[Research] --> A[Analyze] --> W[Write] --> Resp[Response]
    
    style R,A,W fill:#c8e6c9
```

### No Systematic Evaluation

❌ **Bad**: Playing whack-a-mole with errors as they appear

✅ **Good**: Comprehensive error characterization and test suites
