# Evolving Trends in the Industry

## What is an Agent?

An **agent** is an autonomous system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional software that follows predetermined paths, agents exhibit:

- **Autonomy**: Independent decision-making capabilities
- **Reactivity**: Ability to respond to environmental changes  
- **Proactivity**: Goal-directed behavior
- **Social ability**: Interaction with other agents and humans

## How Agents Differ from Other AI Systems

### LLM vs RAG vs Agent

| Pattern | What it is | Capabilities | Use Cases | Limitations | Ops Maturity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LLM + prompt** | Single model call with a prompt. | Text generation, reasoning | Q&A, content creation | Static knowledge, no actions | Low |
| **Chain (e.g. basic RAG)** | Fixed, scripted steps (retrieve → augment → generate). | Knowledge retrieval + generation | Document search, knowledge base | Limited to retrieval | Moderate |
| **Tool-calling agent** | LLM chooses which tool(s) to use at runtime. | Dynamic reasoning + actions | Task automation, workflows | Complexity, reliability | High |
| **Multi-agent** | Router or coordinator orchestrates specialized sub-agents. | Decomposition, parallelism, role specialization, escalation paths. | Complex workflows and multi-domain support. Support triage across HR, IT, and Finance. | Orchestration overhead. Emergent loops. Hardest to debug and attribute. | Very High |


### Ops Maturity Controls by Pattern

| Control | LLM + prompt | Chain (basic RAG) | Tool-calling agent | Multi-agent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Logging & tracing** | Single-step trace<br>Prompt I/O, tokens, latency | Stage traces<br>Query, top-k, scores; versions | Step spans<br>Tool I/O, errors, retries/timeouts | Cross-agent root trace<br>Routing, handoffs, shared-state |
| **Evaluation gates** | Small golden set<br>Correctness, tone, safety | RAG metrics<br>Groundedness, P/R, citations | Task success + side-effects<br>Rollback safety | Per-role + E2E<br>Routes, resolution, escalations, loops |
| **Governance & policy** | Change review<br>Model/prompt registry | Source policy & approvals<br>Index change control | RBAC + high-risk approvals<br>Change mgmt | Cross-role policies<br>Orchestrator gates. Audit trails |
| **Deploy & rollback** | Optional canary<br>Quick rollback | Canary on index/prompt change<br>Rollback to last good | Canary routes + trace replay<br>Staged promotion | Orchestrator-level gates<br>Per-agent versioning |
| **Monitoring & alerts** | Drift basics<br>Rate-limit spikes | Recall & latency drift<br>Index freshness, rate limits | Tool failures/timeouts<br>Quota & rate-limit alerts | Escalation & loop rates<br>Cost/latency by role. Rate-limit hot spots |

- Statistical model validation

### LLMOps Focus
- Ship LLM solutions grounded in data  
- Prompt optimization
- Context window management
- Inference cost optimization
- Safety and alignment

### AgentOps Focus
- Operate safely tool-using single- and multi-agent systems
- **Multi-step reasoning** chains
- **Tool integration** and API management
- **Autonomous decision** making
- **Human-in-the-loop** workflows

## Definition of Agent Ops

> **Agent Ops** is the practice and tooling to build, evaluate, deploy, govern, monitor, and maintain autonomous AI systems that can reason, plan, and take actions to achieve complex goals.

Core principles include:

1. **Reliability**: Agents must perform consistently
2. **Observability**: Understanding agent decision-making  
3. **Safety**: Preventing harmful or unintended actions
4. **Scalability**: Supporting multiple concurrent agents
5. **Maintainability**: Evolving agent capabilities over time

## Agent Ops Anti-patterns

### Starting Too Broad

❌ **Bad**: "Build an internal chatbot that answers every possible employee question"

✅ **Good**: "Build an agent that helps with IT support ticket triage"

### Over-Complex Architecture

❌ **Bad**: Supervisor agents managing sub-agents when a simple chain would work

```{mermaid}
graph TD
    U[User Query] --> S[Supervisor Agent]
    S --> A1[Research Agent]
    S --> A2[Analysis Agent] 
    S --> A3[Writing Agent]
    A1 --> S
    A2 --> S
    A3 --> S
    S --> R[Response]
    
    style S fill:#ffcdd2
    class S bad
```

✅ **Good**: Deterministic chain for predictable workflows

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    U[User Query] --> R[Research] --> A[Analyze] --> W[Write] --> Resp[Response]
    
    style R,A,W fill:#c8e6c9
```

### ReAct Loop for Single-Tool Tasks

❌ **Bad**: Using a Reason→Act loop when one deterministic call would do

```text
LLM: "Thinking..."
→ Tool: getOrderStatus(order_id)
← LLM: "Thinking more..."
→ Tool: getOrderStatus(order_id) (again)
```

✅ **Good**: Direct, parameterized function

```python
status = get_order_status(order_id)  
return format_status(status)
```

### Overcomplicated Tools

❌ **Bad**: e.g., Text-to-SQL when you always need the same query with a single filter field.

✅ **Good**: Parameterized or stored query with allowlisted inputs

### Overcomplicated Retrieval

❌ **Bad**: Vector search/similarity for a simple typo-tolerant lookup

✅ **Good**: Prefer lightweight fuzzy/FTS options where sufficient

- `LIKE` / `ILIKE` contains searches
- Trigram indexes
- Levenshtein distance
- Native full-text search

### Unoptimized Retrieval

❌ **Bad**: Single dense index, oversized chunks, no filters or reranking

✅ **Good**:

- Apply metadata filters
- Right-size chunks and overlap
- Consider hybrid search 
- Add reranking
- Evaluate recall/precision and citation coverage regularly

### Ungoverned Tools

❌ **Bad**: Agents can call any endpoint or run arbitrary code with broad credentials

✅ **Good**:

- Tool registry with explicit schemas and allowlists
- Per-tool permissions, timeouts, and rate limits
- Audit logs and PII redaction for inputs/outputs

### No Rollback / Versioning

❌ **Bad**: Shipping unlogged agents you can’t reproduce

✅ **Good**:

- Version prompts, tools, and routing rules; maintain an agent registry
- Promote via dev -> staging -> prod with canary/shadow options
- Keep a rollback path when metrics regress

### No Systematic Evaluation

❌ **Bad**: Playing whack-a-mole with errors as they appear

✅ **Good**: Comprehensive error characterization and test suites
