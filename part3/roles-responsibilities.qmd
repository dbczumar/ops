# Roles and Responsibilities

## Introduction

The emergence of AgentOps represents a fundamental shift in how organizations structure and manage AI-powered systems. It introduces the need for new role definitions, collaborative patterns, and operational frameworks to handle AI agents, non-deterministic behaviors, and multi-agent interactions. This evolution requires both role specialization and cross-functional integration.
In this section, we will explore key roles and responsabilities within GenAI projects.

## Key Roles

Most organisations are consumers of AI models rather than builders. Their primary focus tends to be on integration and orchestration, agent systems, cost management, prompt engineering, and ensuring safety and governance.

The key roles listed below relate to how organisations implement GenAI. Because GenAI work requires significant collaboration, the exact division of responsibilities often depends on the organisationâ€™s size. In some cases, one person may take on several roles, or hold a hybrid role that combines responsibilities from different areas.

### Technical Roles

These roles directly build, implement, and maintain AI systems, handling the hands-on technical work and domain expertise required to deliver AI solutions.

* Ensure AI initiatives align with business strategy and compliance requirements 

### Emerging Specialized Roles

While many organizations currently distribute these responsibilities among existing technical roles, leading companies are creating dedicated positions as AI systems become more complex and mission-critical.

#### AI Ethics Officer {.unnumbered}

An AI Ethics Officer is responsible for establishing and enforcing governance frameworks that ensure AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly, balancing innovation with ethical principles and regulatory compliance. This includes addressing issues such as fairness, transparency, accountability, and the broader social impacts of AI adoption.

At present, these responsibilities are most often distributed across compliance officers (regulatory alignment), data governance teams (fairness and bias mitigation), and product or research leaders (responsible design and deployment). However, with the growing complexity of AI systems and the rise of formal regulations like the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/), the need for a dedicated role is becoming increasingly clear. As a result, the AI Ethics Officer is emerging as a specialised function in larger organisations and regulated industries.

Primary Responsibilities:

* Develop and enforce responsible AI policies and frameworks
* Conduct bias audits and fairness assessments of AI systems
* Ensure compliance with AI regulations (EU AI Act, industry standards)
* Lead AI governance committees and review boards
* Manage stakeholder communications about AI ethics
* Oversee data privacy and consent for AI systems
* Document AI decision-making processes for accountability


#### AI Safety Engineer {.unnumbered}

An AI Safety Engineer acts as the security specialist for AI systems, implementing technical safeguards against adversarial attacks, harmful outputs, and system failures that traditional security approaches don't address. 

In smaller organisations, these responsibilities are often distributed across AI engineers (who handle basic safety measures), security engineers (who manage traditional security concerns), or platform engineers (who oversee monitoring). However, the unique risks posed by AI, such as prompt injection, model manipulation, and hallucinations, are driving the need for specialised expertise. This trend is reinforced by the fact that leading AI labs like OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind have dedicated AI safety teams, and both the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-institute-overview/introducing-the-ai-safety-institute) and [US](https://www.nist.gov/caisi) governments established AI Safety Institutes to tackle these emerging challenges.

Primary Responsibilities:

* Implement guardrails against prompt injection and jailbreaking attempts
* Build content filtering and moderation systems for AI outputs
* Monitor for agent behavior drift and degradation in production
* Develop testing frameworks for edge cases and failure modes
* Create incident response procedures for AI failures
* Implement audit trails for AI decision-making
* Design fallback mechanisms and human-in-the-loop systems


#### LLMOps Engineer {.unnumbered}

An LLMOps Engineer specializes in the operational complexities unique to large language models, including managing prompt versioning, token optimization, model routing and managing inference costs at scale. 

While AI Engineers and Platform Engineers currently share these duties in most organizations, the complexity of managing multiple models, providers, and deployment patterns is driving specialization.

Primary Responsibilities:

* Manage prompt versioning and A/B testing systems
* Optimize context windows and token usage across applications
* Implement prompt caching and response caching strategies
* Build routing systems for multi-model deployments
* Monitor and optimize inference costs across different models
* Create automated testing for prompt effectiveness
* Manage model migrations and deprecations

#### Prompt Engineer {.unnumbered}

A Prompt Engineer translates business requirements into optimized instructions for AI models, systematically testing and refining prompts to improve accuracy while reducing costs. Today, these responsibilities are typically distributed among AI engineers (technical implementation), subject matter experts (domain knowledge), and product managers (use case definition). However, as organisations expand their use of generative AI, the complexity and scale of prompt design are driving the need for dedicated expertise. With prompt optimisation capable of delivering significant cost savings and the growing need for model-specific prompting techniques, specialised roles are becoming increasingly valuable.

Primary Responsibilities:

* Design and optimize prompt templates for specific business use cases
* Create prompt libraries and maintain documentation
* Conduct systematic testing of prompt variations
* Train non-technical teams on effective AI tool usage
* Develop prompt engineering guidelines and best practices
* Implement few-shot learning examples and chain-of-thought prompting
* Optimize prompts for different models and use cases
